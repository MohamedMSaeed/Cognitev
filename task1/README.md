1. Nginx: as a web server that serve several static webpages.
2. Elasticsearch
3. Filebeat
4. Logstash
5. Kibana 

Nginx generates some log files which are stored in ES. Filebeat take the logs generated by Nginx and push them to Logstash. Logstash make some modifacations and pudh the records to ES to save them.

We will use Kibana as our dashboard.
